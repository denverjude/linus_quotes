	<h1>Linus Torvalds Quotes</h1>

	<img src="http://www.pc-noproblem.com/patres/Torvalds-kernel-free.jpg">
	<h4>Linus Torvald's is the creator of the Linux Kernel and Git. Nuff said !!! Click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank">here</a> to know more though.</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>On the art of introductions at LinuxExpos: My name is Linus Torvalds and I am your god.</li>

			<li>On the art of writing perfect code: Nobody actually creates perfect code the first time around, except me. But there's only one of me.</li>

			<li>On 'crashing' Windows: When you say 'I wrote a program that crashed Windows, people just stare at you blankly and say 'Hey, I got those with the system, for free.</li>

			<li>On the secret of immortality: Every time I see some piece of medical research saying that caffeine is good for you, I high-five myself. Because I'm going to live forever.</li>

			<li>On being polite: Some people think I'm nice and are shocked when they find out different,I'm not a nice person, and I don't care about you. I care about the technology and the kernel—that's what's important to me.
			</li>

			<li>On the delicate matter of diversity: The most important part of open source is that people are allowed to do what they are good at" and "all that [diversity] stuff is just details and not really important.
			</li>

			<li>On the virtue of being professional: Because if you want me to "act professional", I can tell you that I'm not interested. I'm sitting in my home office wearing a bathrobe. The same way I'm not going to start wearing ties, I'm *also* not going to buy into the fake politeness, the lying, the office politics and backstabbing, the passive aggressiveness, and the buzzwords. Because THAT is what "acting professionally" results in: people resort to all kinds of really nasty things because they are forced to act out their normal urges in unnatural ways.</li>

			<li>On coding styles,mostly: Hey, that's not a bug, that's a feature! You know what the most complex piece of engineering known to man in the whole solar system is? Guess what – it's not Linux, it's not Solaris, and it's not your car. It's you. And me. And think about how you and me actually came about – not through any complex design. Right. "Sheer luck". Well, sheer luck, and: 
			- Free availability and crosspollination through sharing of "source code", although biologists call it DNA.
			- A rather unforgiving user environment, that happily replaces bad versions of us with better working versions and thus culls the herd (biologists often call this "survival of the fittest").
			- Massive undirected parallel development ("trial and error").
			I'm deadly serious: we humans have never been able to replicate something more complicated than what we ourselves are, yet natural selection did it without even thinking. Don't underestimate the power of survival of the fittest. And don't ever make the mistake that you can design something better than what you get from ruthless massively parallel trial-and-error with a feedback cycle. That's giving your intelligence much too much credit. Quite frankly, Sun is doomed. And it has nothing to do with their engineering practices or their coding style</li>

			<li>On the choice between open-source and propreitary software:
			Anybody who tells me I can't use a program because it's not open source, go suck on rms(Richard Stallman). I'm not interested. 99% of that I run tends to be open source, but that's my choice, dammit.</li>
			
			<li>On creating commercial ventures:
			First off, I'm actually perfectly well off. I live in a good-sized house, with a nice yard, with deer occasionally showing up and eating the roses (my wife likes the roses more, I like the deer more, so we don't really mind). I've got three kids, and I know I can pay for their education. What more do I need? The thing is, being a good programmer actually pays pretty well; being acknowledged as being world-class pays even better. I simply didn't need to start a commercial company. And it's just about the least interesting thing I can even imagine. I absolutely hate paperwork. I couldn't take care of employees if I tried. A company that I started would never have succeeded – it's simply not what I'm interested in! So instead, I have a very good life, doing something that I think is really interesting, and something that I think actually matters for people, not just me. And that makes me feel good.</li>

			<li>On Future Projects: I am a lazy person, which is why I like open source, for other people to do work for me. I like to sit on the beach with a floofy drink and let you guys do all the work... I’m coasting, right now I’m coasting—I don’t have any projects I’m working on.</li>
			
			<li>On Nvidia: Nvidia, f*** you! </li>

	<p> <em>Disclaimer: Be warned !!! Linus believes believes in being blunt, especially in matters regarding Linux and seems to have a unique sense of humor which is mostly not politically correct. This being said none can deny his contribution to the overall betterment of humanity. Despite what he might claim, he seems to be a more decent human being than many others in the technology field and it would be pretty lame to be offended by the any of the above quotes. ( mostly becuase they're nursery rhymes compared to his <a href="https://adtmag.com/blogs/dev-watch/2014/04/linus-torvalds-rants.aspx" target="_blank">other</a> epic<a href = "http://www.attendly.com/linux-founder-linus-torvalds-delivers-a-smackdown-like-no-other/" target="_blank"> smackdowns.</a>)</em></p>
